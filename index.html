                    Physically disabled and the temporarily injured students most times have a difficult time finding a fast and efficient way to enter buildings for class, dining, study, activities, and more. This can lead to embarrassment or even tardiness to class over something they have no control over. Simple directions would greatly help them find an easier path.
